# Wireframes

- Wireframing refers to the process of creating visual representations of a digital interface, typically in the early stages of design, to outline the structure and layout of the application or website.
- Created these with a tool called Figma. Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that allows teams to create, share, and iterate on designs in real-time, all within a browser-based environment.

### Sample Wireframe
- Used a 4 column grid for designing a sample mobile screen on Figma.
- These low-fidelity wireframes doesn't include the properties like the style, color and other fancy attributes but just the functional ones.
